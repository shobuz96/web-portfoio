            <h3><span class="orange-highlight">2023 - present | Pro level Developer</span></h3>
            <p>My personal definition of a professional developer is a developer who is able to build and maintain a commercial piece of software. In other words, if said developer made or edited software, and that software is generating money for someone somewhere even indirectly, then the developer who made it is professional.</p>
